        <h1>Display</h1>
        <p class="display-desc">
          The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max feature a Super Retina XDR OLED display
          with a typical maximum brightness of 1,000 nits. However, it can go
          all the way up to 1,600 nits while watching HDR videos, and 2,000 nits
          outdoors. The display has a refresh rate of 120 Hz and uses LTPO
          technology. The iPhone 14 Pro has a resolution of 2556×1179 pixels at
          460 pixels per inch (ppi), while the Pro Max variant has a resolution
          of 2796×1290 pixels at 460 ppi. Both variants have an "always on
          display" feature,[25] with an adaptive ProMotion 120 Hz refresh rate
          that can reduce down to 1 Hz to save battery life while in "always on"
          mode.[26] Both models feature a new design for the area that surrounds
          the front-facing camera, which Apple previously referred to as the
          "TrueDepth camera array" and many users referred to as the "notch".
          The new design is called the "Dynamic Island", which is now a
          pill-shaped cutout slightly detached from the top of the screen.[27]
          This design was achieved by moving Face ID hardware components and
          some sensors previously housed in the "notch" behind the display,
          including the ambient light sensor, flood illuminator and proximity
          sensor. To make this new hardware blend more seamlessly with the
          software, software features are added to make the pill shape change
          shape and size according to app and features being used to display
          certain alerts and notifications.
